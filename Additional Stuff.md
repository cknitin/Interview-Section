* ## Diffrence between N-Tire and 3 -Tire
     An N-Tier application is an application where you have 3 or more physical tiers and 3 -Tire application will definitely have 3          tires. 
      
     
* ## Tire vs Layer
 
    ### N-Tire 
     An N-Tier application is an application where you have 3 or more physical tiers.
      * Presentation/Client Tier
      * Application/Business Server Tier
      * Data Tier”
      
     ### N- Layer
     N-Layer application, I mean, with several logic layers where we implement different logic tasks. For example we could have the DAL      layer (Data Access Layer), BLL Layer (Business Logic Layer), BFLL Layer (Busines Façade Logic Layer), WCF Service Layer and several      Presentation layers depending of the pattern we use, like MVC (Model-View-Controller), MVP (Model-View-Presenter), etc..
     
     Note#
     not all N-Layer apps should be N-Tier apps, but all N-Tier Apps must internally be designed as N-Layer
