* ## Define your project architecture 

 My project is physically divided on N-tire architecture, But each tire have multiple layers.
 

* ## Diffrence between N-Tire and 3 -Tire
     An N-Tier application is an application where you have 3 or more physical tiers and 3 -Tire application will definitely have 3          tires. 
     3 -  tires are
          * Presentation Tire
          * Application Logic Tire (Services)
          * Data Tire
 
     #### Presentation Tire
     It has one layer that use the WPF for creating UI it support MMVM design pattern for building the application UI
     #### Application Logic Tire
     This tire some layers that contains the business logics, and these business logics are written in business access layer and              this business layer is access by the serrvice Web API/ WCF. Its also has some other layers like
           * Third parties integrations layer
           * Data access Layer
           * Entities objects layer
           * Common 
           * ORM
     #### Data Tire
     This contains the database server.

     If he ask about example of N-Tire applications - the add the additional layer for running windows servies.
          
* ## Tire vs Layer
 
    #### N-Tire 
     An N-Tier application is an application where you have 3 or more physical tiers.
      * Presentation/Client Tier
      * Application/Business Server Tier
      * Data Tier”
      
    #### N- Layer
    N-Layer application, I mean, with several logic layers where we implement different logic tasks. For example we could have the DAL       layer (Data Access Layer), BLL Layer (Business Logic Layer), BFLL Layer (Busines Façade Logic Layer), WCF Service Layer and several     Presentation layers depending of the pattern we use, like MVC (Model-View-Controller), MVP (Model-View-Presenter), etc.
     
     #### Note#
     Not all N-Layer apps should be N-Tier apps, but all N-Tier Apps must internally be designed as N-Layer
