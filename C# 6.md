# C# 6.0

# $ - string interpolation
The $ special character identifies a string literal as an interpolated string.

        string Name = "Bruce Wyane";
        int age = 26;
        Console.WriteLine($" Hi, I am { Name }, I a, { age } years old.");
        
# Null Operators

C# 6.0 provide two operaters to make the developer life easy

1. null coalescing operator 
2. null-conditional operator

#### Null Coalescing Operator

The ?? operator is the null coalescing operator. It says “If the operand is non-null,
give it to me; otherwise, give me a default value.” For example:

        string s1 = null;
        string s2 = s1 ?? "nothing"; // s2 evaluates to "nothing"
