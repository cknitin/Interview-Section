# C# 6.0

# $ - string interpolation
The $ special character identifies a string literal as an interpolated string.

        string Name = "Bruce Wyane";
        int age = 26;
        Console.WriteLine($" Hi, I am { Name }, I a, { age } years old.");
        
# Null Operators

C# 6.0 provide two operaters to make the developer life easy

1. null coalescing operator 
2. null-conditional operator

#### Null Coalescing Operator

The ?? operator is the null coalescing operator. It says “If the operand is non-null,
give it to me; otherwise, give me a default value.” For example:

        string s1 = null;
        string s2 = s1 ?? "nothing"; // s2 evaluates to "nothing"
#### Null-conditional Operator

The ?. operator is the null-conditional or “Elvis” operator (after the Elvis emoticon), and is new to C# 6. It allows you to call methods and access members just like the standard dot operator, except that if the operand on the left is null, the expression evaluates to null instead of throwing a NullReferenceException:

#### Example 1

        System.Text.StringBuilder sb = null;
        string s = sb?.ToString(); // No error; s instead evaluates to null

The last line is equivalent to:

        string s = (sb == null ? null : sb.ToString());
       
#### Example 2

        x?.y?.z
        
and is equivalent to the following (except that x.y is evaluated only once):

        x == null ? null : (x.y == null ? null : x.y.z)
        
#### Example 3

        System.Text.StringBuilder sb = null;
        int length = sb?.ToString().Length; // Illegal : int cannot be null
        
#### Fix of above 

        int? length = sb?.ToString().Length; // OK : int? can be null
        
You can also use the null-conditional operator to call a void method:

        someObject?.SomeVoidMethod();
        
If someObject is null, this becomes a “no-operation” rather than throwing a NullReferenceException. The null-conditional operator can be used with the commonly used type members that we describe in Chapter 3, including methods, fields, properties and indexers. It
also combines well with the null coalescing operator:

        System.Text.StringBuilder sb = null;
        string s = sb?.ToString() ?? "nothing"; // s evaluates to "nothing"
