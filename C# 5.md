# C# 5.0 

C# 5.0’s big new feature was support for asynchronous functions via two new keywords, async and await. Asynchronous functions enable asynchronous continua‐ tions, which make it easier to write responsive and thread-safe rich-client
applications. They also make it easy to write highly concurrent and efficient I/Obound applications that don’t tie up a thread resource per operation.
