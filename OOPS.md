# Encapsulation
Encapsulation is concept of binding or grouping the data member and member functions in to a single unit as a class.

Real life example is ATM machine

Data member  = Cash
Member functions = Withdraw, Balance check, Last 3 transaction etc.

all the above data members and functions are wrap in a single unit is called ATM machine. 
 

# Data Hiding
Data and encapsulation is the most striking feature of a class. The data is not accessible to the outside world, and only those functions which are wrapped in the class can access it. These functions provide the interface between the object’s data and the program. This insulation of the data from direct access by the program is called data hiding or information hiding. Data Hiding is concept of protecting the data member and member function from access of outside the class. In other words we can not access the data member and member functions outside the class. Data hiding can be controlled using the access modifiers that prefix the class name, method and fields 

# Abstraction 
It's refers to the act of representing essential features without including the background details or explanation. 

# Inheritance 
It's the process by which objects of one class acquired the properties of objects of another classes. It supports the concept of hierarchical classification. In OOP, the concept of inheritance provides the idea of reusability. This means that we can add additional features to an existing class without modifying it


# Polymorphism
It's is another important OOP concept. Polymorphism, a Greek term, means the ability to take more than one form. 
An operation may exhibit different behavior is different instances. The behavior depends upon the types of data used in the operation.
For example, consider the operation of addition. For two numbers, the operation will generate a sum. If the operands are strings, then the operation would produce a third string by concatenation. The process of making an operator to exhibit different behaviors in different instances is known as operator overloading.

In C# how can we achive "Polymorphism"

Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming. It allows you to invoke methods of a derived class through base class reference during runtime. In polymorphism, we will declare methods with same name and different parameters in same class or methods with same name and same parameters in different classes.

Polymorphism has the ability to provide the different implementation of methods that are implemented with the same name.

#### Type of Polymorphism

#### 1. COMPILE TIME POLYMORPHISM (EARLY BINDING OR OVERLOADING OR STATIC BINDING)

Compile time polymorphism means we will declare a method with same name and different parameter/signature because of this we will perform different tasks with same method name in the same class is called compile time polymorphism.


    class Sample
    {
        public int Sum(int a, int b)
        {
            return a + b;
        }

        public int Sum(int a, int b, int c)
        {
            return a + b +c;
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Sample sample = new Sample();
            sample.Sum(10, 20);
            sample.Sum(10, 20, 30);
        }
    }


#### Note 
Method Overloading in C#.NET. The process of creating more than one method in a class with same name or creating a method in derived class with same name as a method in base class is called as method overloading. ... But in C# no need to use any keyword while overloading a method either in same class or in derived class.


#### 2. RUNTIME POLYMORPHISM (LATE BINDING OR OVERRIDING OR DYNAMIC BINDING)

Runtime polymorphism means we will declare a method with same name and same parameter/signature in the different class is called runtime polymorphism.

In the runtime polymorphism we can override a method in base class by creating a similar function in derived class this can be achieved by using inheritance principle and using virtual & override keywords. We can declare methods with the virtual keyword then you can override those methods using virtual keyword in the derived class.

    class Parent
    {
        public void Display()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("This is a parent method.");
        }
    }

    class Child : Parent
    {
        public void Display()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("This is a parent method.");
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Parent p = new Child();

            p.Display();

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

#### Output # 
This is a parent method.

To Fix that use the virtual and override.

    class Parent
    {
        public virtual void Display()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("This is a parent method.");
        }
    }

    class Child : Parent
    {
        public override void Display()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("This is a child method.");
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Parent p = new Child();

            p.Display();

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }


# Secrets of Class in OOPs using C#

1. By defualt a class is internal.
2. A class can not be private in a namespace
3. Inner class can be private, protected, protected internal and protected private.
4. A method in a public class can not return object of a private class i.e. inner class
   
   Example
   
       namespace TestDemo
       {
           class Test
           {
               private class Test1
               {
                   public void Show()
                   {
                   }
               }

               public Test1 TestShow()
               {
                   return new Test1();
               }
           }
       }
       
Error
error CS0050: Inconsistent accessibility: return type 'Test.Test1' is less accessible than method 'Test.TestShow()'     

# Class vs Struct

## Struct
Value Type i.e. whenever a variable is created, it holds the value.
Copying a Struct variable, copies the value.
A new variable is created in Stack memory.
Cannot be inherited.
Cannot be of Abstract type.
Cannot contain Private parameterless constructors.
Doesn’t support Destructor.
 
## Class
Reference Type i.e. whenever a variable is created, it holds the reference (address) while the value is stored some location.
Copying a Class variable, copies the reference while the value remains on same location.
A new variable is created in Heap memory.
Can be inherited.
Can be of Abstract type.
Can contain Private parameterless constructors.
Supports Destructor.



# Garbage Collection
When we are developing any application in dot net memory is the most important concern.
The key purpose of garbage collection is automatic memory management.
There are two ways to clear the memory 
 * Manually 
 * Automatic

Manually memory management lead to the error so we generally don’t use it. So we prefer the AMM i.e. Automatic Memory Management in this technique garbage collector remove the dead objects from memory.

#### Benefits 
* No need worry about memory management.
* It allocate on heap every efficiently.
* Deallocate the memory from unused objects and keep the memory from future use. 

There are two types of object 
Live objects
Dead objects

Heap memory is divided in 3 generation 
Generation 0
Generation 1
Generation 2

#### Generation 0
It is contains the most youngest object. When ever we create a object using new keyword it always get allocated memory in generation 0, if there is not enough space in generation 0 then garbage collector promoted the generation 0 objects to the generation 1.

#### Generation 1
It contain the long live objects, it act as a buffer between generation 0 and generation 1. It also follows the same rules if there is no enough space in generation 1 the garbage collector will promoted the long live object from generation 1 to generation 1. 

#### Generation 2
It contain the longest lived object.

#### How to ensure its a dead object
It check the for application root if application root is any of its object, it also proving the reference of the object the garbage collector does not remove it.

#### Garbage Collector has 3 phases.
 #### Marking Phase
      Create the list of live objects

 #### Reallocating Phase
      It update the reference object 

 #### Compacting Phase
      Clear the unused objects from the heap memory.

# What is the difference between “dispose” and “finalize” variables in C#?
Dispose - This method uses interface – “IDisposable” interface and it will free up both managed and unmanaged codes like – database connection, files etc.

Finalize - This method is called internally unlike Dispose method which is called explicitly. It is called by garbage collector and can’t be called from the code.

# What is the difference between “finalize” and “finally” methods in C#?
Finalize – This method is used for garbage collection. So before destroying an object this method is called as part of clean up activity.

Finally – This method is used for executing the code irrespective of exception occurred or not.

# What is the difference between “throw ex” and “throw” methods in C#?

“throw ex” will replace the stack trace of the exception with stack trace info of re throw point.
“throw” will preserve the original stack trace info.

# Can we use “this” inside a static method in C#?
No. We can’t use “this” in static method.

# Explain String Builder class in C#?
This will represent the mutable string of characters and this class cannot be inherited. It allows us to Insert, Remove, Append and Replace the characters. “ToString()” method can be used for the final string obtained from StringBuilder. For example,

StringBuilder TestBuilder = new StringBuilder("Hello");

TestBuilder.Remove(2, 3); // result - "He"

TestBuilder.Insert(2, "lp"); // result - "Help"

TestBuilder.Replace('l', 'a'); // result - "Heap"



What is the difference between “StringBuilder” and “String” in C#?

StringBuilder is mutable, which means once object for stringbuilder is created, it later be modified either using Append, Remove or Replace.

String is immutable and it means we cannot modify the string object and will always create new object in memory of string type.

# What is the difference between methods – “System.Array.Clone()” and “System.Array.CopyTo()” in C#?
“CopyTo()” method can be used to copy the elements of one array to other. 
“Clone()” method is used to create a new array to contain all the elements which are in the original array.

# How we can sort the array elements in descending order in C#?
To Sort an array, use OrderByDescending method and then “Reverse()” to sort the array in descending order.

    int[] x =  {3,1,6,7,3,2,5,7};
    try
    { 
         x = x.OrderByDescending(r => r).Reverse().ToArray();
         foreach (var item in x)
         {
             Console.WriteLine(item);
         }
     }
     catch (Exception ex)
     {
         throw;
    }

# Find the index of item in array

    int[] x =  {3,1,6,7,3,2,5,7};
    int index = Array.IndexOf(x, 5); // answer : 6
    int index = Array.IndexOf(x, 17); // anwser : -1
    Console.WriteLine(index);

# Explain object pool in C#?
Object pool is used to track the objects which are being used in the code. So object pool reduces the object creation overhead.

# What you mean by delegate in C#?
Delegates are type safe pointers unlike function pointers as in C++. Delegate is used to represent the reference of the methods of some return type and parameters.

# What are the types of delegates in C#?
Below are the uses of delegates in C# -
Single Delegate
Multicast Delegate
Generic Delegate

#What are the three types of Generic delegates in C#?
These are three types of generic delegates in C# -
Func
Action
Predicate

# What are the uses of delegates in C#?
Below are the list of uses of delegates in C# -
Callback Mechanism

Asynchronous Processing
Abstract and Encapsulate method
Multicasting

# Can we use delegates for asynchronous method calls in C#?
Yes. We can use delegates for asynchronous method calls.

# Why to use “Nullable Coalescing Operator” (??) in C#?
Nullable Coalescing Operator can be used with reference types and nullable value types. So if the first operand of the expression is null then the value of second operand is assigned to the variable. For example,

double? myFirstno = null;

double mySecno;

mySecno = myFirstno ?? 10.11;

# What is the difference between “as” and “is” operators in C#?
“as” operator is used for casting object to type or class.
“is” operator is used for checking the object with type and this will return a Boolean value.

# What you mean by boxing and unboxing in C#?
Boxing – This is the process of converting from value type to reference type. For example,
int myvar = 10;
object myObj = myvar;

UnBoxing – It’s completely opposite to boxing. It’s the process of converting reference type to value type. For example,
int myvar2 = (int)myObj;

# Explain Partial Class in C#?
Partial classes concept added in .Net Framework 2.0 and it allows us to split the business logic in multiple files with the same class name

Other use of partial
 - interface, struct, methods (retun type is void, and alway private)
 - partial can also be use with generics
 - Abstract class also be partial and all the parital classes will be abstract.
 
# Enum 

     namespace TestDemo
     {
         class Test
         {
             public enum x
             {
                 First,
                 Second,
                 Third = 100,
                 Fourth
             };

         }

         class Program
         {
             static void Main(string[] args)
             {
                 Test t = new Test();
                 Console.WriteLine(t.x.Fourth); //  'x': cannot reference a type through an expression; try 'Test.x'     instead
                 Console.WriteLine(Test.x.Fourth);
                 Console.ReadLine();
             }
         }
     }




# Struct
 1. It can nnot be inherit


# Shallow Copy

Shallow copying is creating a new object and then copying the non static fields of the current object to the new object. If the field is a value type, a bit by bit copy of the field is performed. If the field is a reference type, the reference is copied but the referred object is not, therefore the original object and its clone refer to the same object. A shallow copy of an object is a new object whose instance variables are identical to the old object. In .Net shallow copy is done by the object method MemberwiseClone().

The situations like , if you have an object with values and you want to create a copy of that object in another variable from same type, then you can use shallow copy, all property values which are of value types will be copied, but if you have a property which is of reference type then this instance will not be copied, instead you will have a reference to that instance only.
  
    class Demo
    {
       public string FirstName { get; set; }
       public string LastName { get; set; }
       public Demo Copy()
       {
           return (Demo)this.MemberwiseClone();
       }
       public void Print(string objectName)
       {
           Console.WriteLine($"Object Name- {objectName} \nFirst Name- {FirstName} \nLast Name- {LastName}");
       }
    }

    class Program
    {
       static void Main(string[] args)
       {
         Demo d1 = new Demo();
         d1.FirstName = "Peter";
         d1.LastName = "Parker";
         d1.Print("d1");

         Demo d2 = new Demo();
         d2 = d1.Copy();
         d2.FirstName = "Rachel";
         d2.Print("d2");
         d1.Print("d1");
         Console.ReadLine();
      }
    }

# Deep Copy

Deep copy is creating a new object and then copying the non-static fields of the current object to the new object. If a field is a value type, a bit by bit copy of the field is performed. If a field is a reference type, a new copy of the referred object is performed. A deep copy of an object is a new object with entirely new instance variables, it does not share objects with the old. While performing Deep Copy the classes to be cloned must be flagged as [Serializable].

Deep copy is intended to copy all the elements of an object, which include directly referenced elements of value type and the indirectly referenced elements of a reference type that holds a reference to a memory location that contains data rather than containing the data itself.


    class Demo:ICloneable
    {
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }

        public object Clone()
        {
            return this.MemberwiseClone();
        }
        public void Print(string objectName)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Object Name- {objectName} \nFirst Name- {FirstName} \nLast Name- {LastName}");
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)

            d1.LastName = "Parker";

            d1.Print("d1");

            Demo d2 = new Demo();
            d2 = (Demo)d1.Clone();
            d2.FirstName = "Rachel";
            d2.Print("d2");
            d1.Print("d1");

# Func vs Action 

Func and Action are predefined generic delegates, which take zero to sixteen input parameters.
The basic difference between both is that Func always returns a value while Action doesn’t return a value.
Both Func and Action delegates must be defined before they are called, while a Local function can be defined later in the method.

     Func<int,(int,string)> example1Func = (int x) =>
     {
         Console.WriteLine("Write {0}", x);
         return (x,"");
     };

     Func<int, int,int> example2Func = (x, y) =>
     {
         Console.WriteLine("Write {0} and {1}", x, y);
         return x + y;
     };

     Func<int> example3Func = () =>
     {
         Console.WriteLine("Done");
         return 10;
     };
     
     
     // Func
     // Can take 16 input and 1 output
     Func<int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int,int > sum = 
         delegate (int a1, int a2, int a3, int a4, int a5, int a6, int a7, int a8, int a9, int a10, 
         int a11, int a12, int a13, int a14, int a15, int a16)
     {
         return a1 + a2;
     };
     int result = sum(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,167);
     Console.WriteLine(result);


     // Func
     Func<int, bool> checkPrimeNumber = x =>
     {
         bool isPrime = false;
         int i;
         for (i = 2; i <= x - 1; i++)
         {
             if (x % i == 0)
             {
                 isPrime = false;
                 break;
             }
         }

         return isPrime;
     };
     
     
     
     Action<int> example1 = (int x) => 
     {
         Console.WriteLine("Write {0}", x);
     };

     Action<int, int> example2 = (x, y) => 
     {
         Console.WriteLine("Write {0} and {1}", x, y);
     };

     Action example3 = () => 
     {
         Console.WriteLine("Done");
     };

     // Call the anonymous methods.
     example1.Invoke(1);
     example2.Invoke(2, 3);
     example3.Invoke();

         int a8, int a9, int a10, int a11, int a12, int a13, int a14, int a15, int a16)
     {
         Console.WriteLine(a1 * a1);
     };
     
     




# Predicate    

A Predicate returns true or false
This C# type stores a method that receives 1 parameter and returns 1 value of true or false.
And it is often used with lambda expression syntax.

      //
      // This Predicate instance returns true if the argument is one.
      //
      Predicate<int> isOne =
          x => x == 1;
      //
      // This Predicate returns true if the argument is greater than 4.
      //
      Predicate<int> isGreaterEqualFive =
          (int x) => x >= 5;


      //
      // Test the Predicate instances with various parameters.
      //
      Console.WriteLine(isOne.Invoke(1));
      Console.WriteLine(isOne.Invoke(2));
      Console.WriteLine(isGreaterEqualFive.Invoke(3));
      Console.WriteLine(isGreaterEqualFive.Invoke(10));



# Local Function

The Local function is a new concept introduced in C# 7. 
The Local function can be defined in the body of any method and property’s getter and setter.
All the arguments and the local variables in the outer function are in scope of a local function.
These local functions can use ref and out parameters.

     // Local Function
     int num = 10;
     long GetFactorial(int number)
     {
         return number == 0 ? 1 : number * GetFactorial(number - 1);
     }
     long fact = GetFactorial(num);
     Console.WriteLine($"{num} factorial is {fact}");
     
     
# Abstract Class
It's a partially implemented class

1. We can not have abstratc method in non abstratc class
2. A abstract class can have both abstratc and non- abstract methds
3. Can not create the instance of abstratc class
4. Its mandatroy to override the abstratc method in derived class
5. Derived class can not have same name method as abstrat class
6. Abstract class can have the construtor.
7. Abstrct method can not be private
8. Abstract method can not be virtual

         abstract class Demo
         {
             public void ShowFirstName()
             {
                 Console.WriteLine("I am James.");
             }

             public override void ShowLastName()
             {
                 Console.WriteLine("I am Anderson.");
             }
         }

## Use of abstract, override and new together 

    abstract class Demo
    {
        public abstract void Show();
    }

    class Demo1 : Demo
    {
        public override void Show()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Demo 1");
        }
    }

    class Demo2 : Demo1
    {
        public sealed override void Show()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Demo 2");
        }
    }

    class Demo3 : Demo2
    {
        public new void Show()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Demo 2");
        }
    }
    
## Note:
Finally a sealed modifier breaks the chain of virtual methods and makes them not overridable again. This is not used often, but the option is there. It makes more sense with a chain of 3 classes each deriving from the previous one

A -> B -> C


# Interface
Interface is a contract which is going to implement fully with their derived class.
Can contain only declaration of Members and not definition.
Can not create object  
Members are defined without using the override keyword.
Cannot contain Access modifiers i.e. Members cannot be public, private, etc.

#### The advantages of an abstract class are:

Ability to specify default implementations of methods with definition
It can be use where base and derive class have similar functionality.

# What is a Sealed class in C#?
A Sealed class is a class which cannot be inherited. 
A sealed class can be public as well as private.
We can create the object of seal class

public sealed class A
{
   public void Fun()
   {
   }
}
//Compiler Error: 'B': cannot derive from sealed type 'A'
public class B : A
{
   public static void Fun()
   {

   }
}

We can create object of seal class.

A a = new A();
C.Fun();

#### We can also have the Seal methods

 class Demo2
 {
     public virtual void Greeting1()
     {
         Console.WriteLine("Greeting1 from Demo2.");
     }

     public virtual void Greeting2()
     {
         Console.WriteLine("Greeting2 from Demo2.");
     }
 }

 class Demo3:Demo2
 {
     public override void Greeting1()
     {
         Console.WriteLine("Greeting1 from Demo3.");
     }

     // Sealed also can be used with method to avoid override.
     sealed public override void Greeting2()
     {
         Console.WriteLine("Greeting1 from Demo3.");
     }
 }

 class Demo4 : Demo3
 {
     // Sealed also can be used with method to avoid override.
     // In this class you can not override the Greeting2() method due to sealed 
     public override void Greeting1()
     {
         Console.WriteLine("Greeting1 from Demo4.");
     }
}

# What is an Internal class in C#?
An Internal class is a class which cannot be used outside its Assembly. The internal keyword is used to mark a particular class Internal i.e. it restrict its access outside the Assembly.
•      An Assembly could be a Project, a DLL or an EXE.
•      Inside the Assembly, the internal class is like public class.
•      An internal class can be inherited within the Assembly.

# Protected Internal
“protected internal” can be accessed in the same assembly and the child classes can also access these methods.




# Optional vs Named Parameters

Optional Parameters
An optional parameter has a default value. A method with an optional parameter can be called with only some of its parameters specified. Using this feature in new versions of the C# language, we add default values for formal parameters.




     using System;

     class Program
     {
         static void Main()
         {
             // Omit the optional parameters.
             Method();

             // Omit second optional parameter.
             Method(4);

             // You can't omit the first but keep the second.
             // Method("Dot");

             // Classic calling syntax.
             Method(4, "Dot");

             // Specify one named parameter.
             Method(name: "Sam");

             // Specify both named parameters.
             Method(value: 5, name: "Allen");
         }

         static void Method(int value = 1, string name = "Perl")
         {
             Console.WriteLine("value = {0}, name = {1}", value, name);
         }
     }

     Output

     value = 1, name = Perl
     value = 4, name = Perl
     value = 4, name = Dot
     value = 1, name = Sam
     value = 5, name = Allen
    
# Private Construtor

1. You can not create the object of that class which has "Private Construtor".
2. You can not inherit that class with the derive class which has "Private Construtor".  

# Virtual

Virtual method can not be private

     namespace TestDemo
     {
  
         public class Base
         {
             public virtual void Show()

# Static class

1. Static class cannot have non static members.
2. Access modifiers are not allowed on static constructors
3. Static class can not have instance constructor
4. Static class can not be inherit
5. Can not create the object of static class
6. Static constructor invoke once for any number of instance, it is use to initialize static member fields, by default static      constructor is public and access modifiers can not be use with static constructor.
8. If the class is made static then all the members of the class are also made static. 
9. All members in static class must be statics If the variable is made static then it will have a single instance and the value change is updated in this instance

Non static Class With static members
It can have both static and non static members.
It can have both static and non static constructor. 
Non static filed can not be access in static constructors.
If a class have both static and non static constructor then static constructor will call first.
